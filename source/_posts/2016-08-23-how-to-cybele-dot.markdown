Cybele is not an anatolian goddess, actually it is but we're not talking about her.We're talking about a rails gem.It's an 
awesome tool to start a new project.It has everything you need when you develop a professional website.In short, it is a starting template.

Before I start I have to mention my friend mrk because he inspired me to write this.Since he does not seem to write an english 
version of his,I feel obligated to write for developers all around the world.Ä±f you wanna read his stuff, click [here](http://www.muratrahmikurtul.com)

Here we go, first we need to install redis and sidekiq to take care background jobs and cybele works in rails 4.2.x versions right now if you're using Rails 5 or one of older versions you need to change it to 4.2.After that just install cybele gem using:

	gem install cybele

Then just start a project by writing:
	
	cybele project_name

on your terminal.Then set your local environment variables and access token in config/initializers/rollbar.rb.

	ROOT_PATH=http://localhost:3000
	SMTP_PASSWORD=
	SMTP_USER_NAME=admin@deneme.com
	SMTP_ADDRESS=smtp.sendgrid.net

	BASIC_AUTH_IS_ACTIVE=no
	S3_BUCKET_NAME=deneme-v3-staging
	AWS_RAW_URL=deneme-v3-staging.s3.amazonaws.com
	AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
	AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=


You can get detailed info about setting your local variables from [here](http://railsapps.github.io/rails-environment-variables.html).After that in your migration folder set your default values for **is_active** and 
**time_zone** variables in Admin and User models.Be sure that you do this changes before the *rake db:migrate* command.  

![migratepic](/images/pic2.jpg)

After setting the migration file, change username and password in /config/settings.yml as you like.Then  in public folder run this command 

	ln -s ../VERSION.txt VERSION.txt

This was the final step if you know how to use postrgresql because cybele uses postgresql.If you don't have postgresql,you can install by running this command on your terminal

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib

If you already have it, open the psql using this command

	sudo -u postgres psql

After that you need to create a database and a user.Before this step just be sure that you add a username and a password in your **config/database.yml** file.When you are creating a database,database name should match on your database name in database.yml file.If probably be like name_of_your_app_ development.So you should run a command like this

	CREATE DATABASE "project_name_development";

When creating user

	CREATE USER user_name WITH PASSWORD 'password' 

after this we need to alter our user as superuser

	ALTER USER user_name WITH SUPERUSER

Now we can leave our psql writing */q* or simply using ctrl+d and creat our database and migrate it using

	rake db:create
	rake db:migrate
	rake dev:seed

Finally we can run the server but before that make sure you run the redis each time because redis is back tracking our app.So run this

	redis-server

aaand

	rails s

tadaaa

You can wonder its admin panel just using

	0.0.0.0:3000/hq

the password and and username is in seeds.rb file, that's because you sholdn't forget to run *rake dev:seed*

Thanks for reading..
